Start the Development Server:
React apps come with a built-in development server. To start it, run:

- npm start

This command will start the development server, and your default web browser will open, showing the running React app. The development server watches for changes in your code and automatically reloads the app.

Access the App:
Open your web browser and go to 
- http://localhost:65534 
to see your running React app.


We can also run to the UBC Ugrad Oracle Server using:

- node server.js
